# poe_wiki_scrapper_discord_bot
It's a discord bot that uses previously scraped data using Scrapy package from wiki of Path of Exile (aRPG game) and responds with info about asked item.

To make it work first you have to run Scrapy spider, it outputs data about every item in UniqueItemsList.json from which discord bot takes data.
